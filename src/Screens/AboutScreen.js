      <h1 className="center">About Me</h1> <hr />
      <p className="center">
      Hello there! I'm Cyra, a passionate and driven software developer with a strong
       foundation in web development. I hold Level 5 & 6 certificates from the esteemed Mission Ready
        Professional Software Developer courses, which have equipped me with a solid understanding
         of industry best practices and cutting-edge technologies.
        <br />
        <br/>
        During my academic journey, I had the incredible opportunity to gain practical experience
         through an internship, where I contributed to an online learning platform project for Dacreed.
        <br />
        <br />
        Inspired by my passion for creating impactful solutions, I embarked on a personal project called
         PropertEasy, a full-stack property website aimed at revolutionizing the rental experience for
          landlords and tenants. As the project lead, I have honed my skills in TypeScript, Trpc, and
         frontend technologies to deliver a seamless and user-friendly platform.
        <br /> 
        <br />
        My experiences have instilled in me a strong commitment to continuous learning and improvement. 
        I embrace challenges as opportunities to grow, always seeking innovative ways to refine my coding
         abilities and stay up -to-date with the rapidly evolving tech landscape.
         <br/>
        <br />
         I am enthusiastic about collaborating with talented teams to create impactful software solutions
          that make a difference. If you're looking for a dedicated and motivated developer who thrives in
           dynamic environments, I'd love to connect and explore potential opportunities to contribute my
           skills and passion.
           <br/>
        <br />
           Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and I look forward to connecting with you soon!
