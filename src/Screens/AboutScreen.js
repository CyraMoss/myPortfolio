        Hi! my name is Cyra, i'm a 26 years old Front-End software Developer
        from Auckland, New Zealand. <br />
        When I started thinking about what I wanted to do for a career I thought
        about something to do with computers straight away. I was trying to find
        something I would enjoy so I tried a level 3 computing course and liked
        it so much I did level 4 & 5 aswell.
        <br />
        When I decided to do software development I came across a course called
        SheCodes, so I signed up!
        <br />
        SheCodes is an all female coding bootcamp, they taught me about HTML,
        CSS, JS, API's, GitHub, Bootstrap, Hosting, SEO, Responsive and React. I
        did all their courses and it was super fun.
        <br /> After SheCodes I started Misson Ready which is an advanced
        software developer Acellorator. they taught me alot about agile mindset
        and practices, Devops and automated deployment, cloud servises, Design
        Thinking and more
